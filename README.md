## 🔹 Features
- Relational database schema for **patients, providers, medications, imaging orders**
- Sample data to simulate real-world clinical workflows
- SQL queries to demonstrate reporting and workflow analysis:
  - Patients scheduled for MRI tomorrow
  - Provider productivity by imaging orders
  - Active medication orders per patient

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- SQL database design & queries  
- Healthcare IT workflows (Epic Willow, Radiant, Cupid concepts)
